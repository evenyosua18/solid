# SOLID Principle

### Five software design principles:
- **S** - Single Responsibility Principle
- **O** - Open / Closed Principle
- **L** - Liskov Substitution Principle
- **I** - Interface Segregation Principle
- **D** - Dependency Inversion Principle

### Why SOLID
To **avoid** typical issues in software development:
- rigidity (difficult to make change)
- fragility (change brings service and development interruption)
- immobility (poor re-usability)
- viscosity (highly design coupling, difficult to apply changes)

## SOLID in Details
### S - Single Responsibility Principle
*A class should have one, and only one, reason to change. - Robert C Martin*



### O - Open / Closed Principle
### L - Liskov Substitution Principle
### I - Interface Segregation Princple
### D - Dependency Inversion Principle
